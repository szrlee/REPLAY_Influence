## 📈 **DESIGN GOALS & STATUS**

-   **Numerical Equivalence**: The replay mechanism aims to be numerically equivalent to the original training steps, which is critical for the validity of influence scores. Deviations due to necessary clipping are configurable and documented.
-   **Component Consistency**: Ensuring that components like models, dataloaders, and optimizers behave identically under the same configurations is a primary design goal, detailed in the determinism strategy.
-   **Research Suitability**: The overall system is designed to be a reliable tool for research into influence functions and model behavior.
