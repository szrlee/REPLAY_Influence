## 🎯 **Overview**

This project implements state-of-the-art methods for understanding how individual training data points affect a model's predictions and internal states. It provides a **production-ready, research-grade implementation** with comprehensive quality assurance and deterministic reproducibility.

### **Core Methodologies**

1. **🔮 MAGIC Influence Analysis**: Computes influence scores for training samples using advanced TracIn/REPLAY methodologies. These scores identify which training examples were most responsible for a model's behavior on specific test instances - invaluable for model debugging, understanding dataset biases, and identifying influential or mislabeled training data.

2. **🔬 LDS Validation System**: Empirically validates computed influence scores by training multiple models on systematically generated subsets of training data. Performance correlation with influence scores provides rigorous validation of influence estimation accuracy.

The system uses **CIFAR-10 dataset** and **ResNet9 architecture** as a concrete testbed, with **complete deterministic reproducibility** and **enterprise-grade error handling**.

## Running the Analyses

The primary entry point for running the analyses is `main_runner.py`. You can see all available options by running:
```bash
python main_runner.py --help
```

**Workflow:**

The typical workflow involves:
1.  Running the MAGIC analysis to compute influence scores for a target validation image.
2.  Optionally, running the LDS validation, which uses the scores from the MAGIC analysis.

**Examples:**

1.  **Run only the MAGIC influence analysis:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --run_magic
    ```
    This will:
    *   Automatically verify data ordering consistency before training
    *   Train a ResNet9 model on CIFAR-10 from scratch, saving model checkpoints at each training step to `outputs/checkpoints_magic/`
    *   Compute influence scores for a pre-defined target validation image (configured in `src/config.py`)
    *   Save the raw influence scores as a pickled NumPy array to `outputs/scores_magic/`
    *   Generate and save a plot of the most and least influential training images for the target image to `outputs/plots_magic/`

2.  **Run only the LDS validation (requires pre-computed MAGIC scores):**
    LDS validation relies on influence scores generated by the MAGIC analysis.
    *   If `magic_analyzer.py` was run previously and its `MAGIC_TARGET_VAL_IMAGE_IDX` matches `LDS_TARGET_VAL_IMAGE_IDX_FOR_CORRELATION` in `src/config.py`, LDS validation can find the scores file automatically.
      ```bash
      python main_runner.py --run_lds
      ```
    *   Alternatively, you can explicitly specify the path to the MAGIC scores file:
      ```bash
      python main_runner.py --run_lds --magic_scores_file outputs/scores_magic/magic_scores_per_step_val_21.pkl
      ```
    This will:
    *   Perform comprehensive data ordering verification (6 tests) to ensure consistency with MAGIC
    *   Generate definitions for training data subsets (or load them if they exist from a previous run, see `outputs/indices_lds.pkl`)
    *   Train multiple ResNet9 models with identical initialization, each on a different data subset, saving their final checkpoints to `outputs/checkpoints_lds/`
    *   Evaluate these subset-trained models on the entire validation set and save their per-sample validation losses to `outputs/losses_lds/`
    *   Correlate the performance of these subset-trained models (specifically, their loss on the target validation image) with predictions derived from the MAGIC influence scores
    *   Generate and save a correlation plot to `outputs/plots_lds/`

3.  **Run both MAGIC and LDS sequentially:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --run_magic --run_lds
    ```
    This is a convenient way to ensure the MAGIC scores are generated and then immediately used by the LDS validation, especially if the target validation image for both analyses is the same (as per default configuration).

4.  **Run with memory-efficient mode (recommended for large datasets):**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --run_magic --memory_efficient
    ```
    This mode saves memory by streaming batch data from disk during replay instead of keeping all batches in memory. Reduces memory usage by approximately 80% with minimal performance impact.

5.  **Run with custom logging:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --run_magic --log_level DEBUG --log_file analysis.log
    ```
    This enables debug logging and saves logs to a file for detailed debugging and progress tracking.

6.  **Show configuration summary:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --show_config
    ```
    This displays all configuration parameters and validation results, then exits without running any analysis.

7.  **Force recomputation of existing results:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --run_magic --force_retrain --force_recompute
    ```
    Use these flags to force regeneration of model checkpoints (`--force_retrain`) or influence scores (`--force_recompute`).

## Cleanup Options

The project provides options to clean up output files generated by previous analysis runs:

1.  **Clean MAGIC analysis outputs:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --clean_magic
    ```
    This will remove:
    *   MAGIC model checkpoints from `outputs/checkpoints_magic/`
    *   MAGIC influence scores from `outputs/scores_magic/`
    *   MAGIC plots from `outputs/plots_magic/`
    *   The batch dictionary file used for REPLAY computation

2.  **Clean LDS validation outputs:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --clean_lds
    ```
    This will remove:
    *   LDS subset model checkpoints from `outputs/checkpoints_lds/`
    *   LDS validation loss files from `outputs/losses_lds/`
    *   LDS correlation plots from `outputs/plots_lds/`
    *   LDS subset indices file (`outputs/indices_lds.pkl`)

3.  **Clean both MAGIC and LDS outputs:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --clean_magic --clean_lds
    ```

4.  **Clean and then run fresh analyses:**
    ```bash
    python main_runner.py --clean_magic --clean_lds --run_magic --run_lds
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Data Ordering Verification Failed**
   ```
   Error: Data ordering mismatch between MAGIC and LDS - cannot proceed with validation
   ```
   **Solution**: Check that `MAGIC_MODEL_TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE == LDS_MODEL_TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE` and `MAGIC_TARGET_VAL_IMAGE_IDX == LDS_TARGET_VAL_IMAGE_IDX_FOR_CORRELATION` in `src/config.py`.

2. **Memory Issues During MAGIC Analysis**
   ```
   RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
   ```
   **Solution**: Use the memory-efficient mode with `--memory_efficient` flag or reduce batch size in `src/config.py`.

3. **Missing MAGIC Scores for LDS Validation**
   ```
   FileNotFoundError: MAGIC scores file not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Run MAGIC analysis first with `--run_magic` or specify the correct path with `--magic_scores_file`.

4. **Configuration Validation Errors**
   ```
   ValueError: MAGIC_MODEL_TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE must be positive
   ```
   **Solution**: Check all parameters in `src/config.py` are properly set. Use `--show_config` to see current values.

### Debug Mode
For detailed debugging information:
```bash
python main_runner.py --run_magic --run_lds --log_level DEBUG --log_file debug.log
```

This provides extensive logging of:
- Data ordering verification steps
- Model initialization processes
- Training progress and memory usage
- File I/O operations
- Configuration validation results

## Notes

### Important Considerations
*   **CIFAR-10 Data Path**: The scripts assume CIFAR-10 will be downloaded to `/tmp/cifar/` by default. This can be changed by modifying `CIFAR_ROOT` in `src/config.py`.
*   **Memory Usage**: The project now supports both memory-efficient and standard modes. Memory-efficient mode is recommended for larger datasets or systems with limited RAM.
*   **Reproducibility**: All random operations are properly seeded to ensure reproducible results. The verification system ensures data ordering consistency across all components.
*   **File Organization**: Separate output directories for MAGIC and LDS components prevent file conflicts and make cleanup easier.

### Performance Notes
*   **Memory-Efficient Mode**: Trades ~10% speed for ~80% memory reduction during replay
*   **DataLoader Workers**: Configured for optimal balance between speed and determinism
*   **Checkpoint Management**: Automatic detection of existing checkpoints prevents redundant computation
*   **Batch Processing**: Optimized batch sizes and processing for typical hardware configurations
